            <h1>Should I Drink More Coffee?</h1>
            <p>
                This is a valid question that I ask myself every day. While you take your break here are the facts
                about coffee, caffine, and if you should have more or not.
            </p>
            <p>Coffee contains caffeine, a common and well known stimulant that fights fatigue and increases energy
                levels. This works for anyone, but is most commonly consumed by students, influencers, full time
                Moms,
                and
                workers who are underpaid.
            <p>
                Caffeine works by blocking one of our bodies sleep-inducing molecules: adenosine. Adenosine slows
                down
                our brain signals and is the main reason we get tired throughout the day or before bed. Caffeine
                disrupts
                this process, making it so adenosine never tells your body to get tired. Caffeine can also help
                boost
                positive feelings. When you get tired by way of adenosine, dopamine has a hard time lifting your
                mood.
                While
                caffeine is blocking adenosine, dopamine can continue telling your body to be happy. These effects
                have
                long-term
                benefits too, reducing the risk of diseases.
            </p>
            <p>The real reason coffee is helpful and students love it so much? It helps you stay awake longer, and
                you
                are therefore able to be more productive.
            </p>
            <p>
            <p><em>Why does caffeine stop working?</em></p>
            Your brain will start adapting to the caffeine you have been drinking, and create more ways to listen to
            adenosine. This means that even when you drink caffeine, adenosine will continue to tell your body you
            need sleep making caffeine less and less effective.
            Be cautious, caffeine is a drug and withdrawal for caffeine can happen, but only for a few days. You
            should take a week break from caffeine to restart this process, let your body readjust so you can start
            drinking caffeine again in lower doses, but feel better and even more awake than before.
            </p>
            <p>
                I suggest this after finals.

                <p>
                <p>Set time aside</p>
                <p>Study breaks can be missed if you do not actively set time aside for them. </p>
                <p>No Social Media</p>
                <p>Being on your phone is not an effective break. You need to get your eyes and mind away from a screen
                    and/or small text.</p>
                <p> Move your Body</p>
                <p>Take a walk around where you are. Taking a shower is also a nice way to feel productive but get your
                    mind away from school. </p>
                <p>Get Coffee</p>
                <p> Caffeine is a great way to improve your mood and give you extra
                    energy to study a little longer. Coffee is my caffine drink of choice. </p>
                <p> Other Ideas</p>
                <p> Organize your work space, listen to music, get a snack. If you&apos;re with friends, take a break
                    together to
                    talk and laugh. Stretching is also a great thing to do, especially if you have been sitting for
                    hours.
                    Don&apos;t be afraid to let your mind just wander, daydreaming is a great way to rest and reset.
                </p>
                <p>Time</p>
                <p> It is recommended to take a break from five minutes to one hour. Set a timer for what you feel is
                    appropriate and stick to it. Not only when to take a break, but how long the break is. </p>
